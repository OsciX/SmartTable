This project was worked on at GHP 54 by a group composed of:
- Ryan Davis (Software Engineering)
- Andrew Sonnier (Software Engineering)
- Zach Yahn (Prototyping)
- Adam Siffel (Prototyping)
- Matthew Lescota (Design)

The effort, nicknamed Project:Project because of projector usage, made use of a Microsoft Kinect and a short-throw projector. It was officially completed on July 14, 2017, shortly preceding the team's departure from GHP.
