The Group of 20 summit came up with compromise language on trade, although officials struggled to find common ground on another contentious issue, fighting climate change. In the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris climate agreement, the group agreed in a draft statement to \"take note\" of the U.S. withdrawal while the other 19 reaffirmed support of the Paris deal to limit emissions of greenhouse gases scientist say are behind global warming, leaving the U.S. as the sole outlier.","url":"https://apnews.com/bfaf33768a2644339f9be816ff5ff15c","urlToImage":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:39e98117d6954a91bdfc1e2d639435f2/3000.jpeg","publishedAt":"2017-07-08T13:47:03Z"},{"author":"KEN THOMAS and DARLENE SUPERVILLE","title":"Trump seeks consensus on trade, North Korea at summit","description":"HAMBURG, Germany (AP) — Fresh from his lengthy head-to-head encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday dove into discussions on trade and North Korea in a packed agenda with world leaders at an international summit.
